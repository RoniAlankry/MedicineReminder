## MedicineReminder
This is an IoT-based smart medicine reminder system built with C++ and the ESP32 microcontroller. Designed to help patients adhere to their medication schedules, this device provides visual and auditory alerts, as well as real-time remote monitoring.

##Features
Visual and Auditory Alerts: Integrates NeoPixel LEDs and a speaker to remind users to take medication.
Touch Sensor for Interaction: Allows users to interact with the device by acknowledging alerts.
Remote Monitoring: Connects to Blynk for real-time monitoring and notifications.
Customizable Schedules: Set reminders for morning and night doses, synced with NTP for accurate timing.
##Tech Stack
#Language: C++
